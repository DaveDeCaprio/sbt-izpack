* Fixed a problem with `logLevel` handling.
* `failureType` in an `executable` (within a `pack`) now defaults to
  `warn`. (It didn't have a default, but was required.)
* `stage` in an `executable` (within a `pack`) now defaults to
  `never`. (It didn't have a default, but was required.)
* Added missing `type` field to `executable` XML element.
* Now published for Scala 2.8.1, 2.9.0 and 2.9.0-1.
