Markdown SBT Plugin
==================

## Introduction

This project contains a [Markdown][markdown] plugin for the [SBT][sbt]
build tool. This Markdown plugin uses the [Showdown][showdown] Javascript 
Markdown parser and the Mozilla [Rhino][rhino] Javascript engine to convert
Markdown into HTML. For details on the approach, see my
[Parsing Markdown in Scala][markdown-blog] blog entry.
