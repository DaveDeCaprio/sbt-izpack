Version 0.1:

Completely rewrote my SBT 0.7 [IzPack][] plugin for [SBT][] 0.10.x. Now
uses a YAML configuration file, rather than a [Scala][] DSL, for
configuration, resulting in a more compact (and, arguably, more readable)
configuration.

[Scala]: http://www.scala-lang.org/
[SBT]: https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/
